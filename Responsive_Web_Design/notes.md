# Intro to Responisve Web Design

Relative unitws for font-size include em and rem.

Relative to the viewport - vw, vh,vmin,vmax

## Percentages

Are relative to the parent element.

## min and max width

e.g max-width: 620px

this will lock the element to a max width of 620 pixels not streching it to a weird size if you where to use 90 %

min-width: 500px

would stop shriking at 500px

you can put them in any order.
