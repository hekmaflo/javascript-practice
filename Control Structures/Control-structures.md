## Conditional Code Execution

important for conditional Code: Return True or False

== used to compared two values
!= check for value inequality
=== and !== check for value AND Type

e.g. 2 === 2 equals TRUE
2 === "2" would be FALSE

=== and !== is prefered over == or !=

> & < check for value that is greater / smaller

> = & <= check for valeu being greater or equal / smaller or equal

! check if NOT true
