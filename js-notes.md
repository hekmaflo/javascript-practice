## Variables & Constants

A "data container"/ "data storage"
ex. Let userName = "Max";
userName = "Manu"; would reassign userName variable and would not need a let since it was already declared

const totalUsers = 15

is a constant meaning that it cannot be change.

Use constants as often as possible (whenever you have values that aren't changing.)
